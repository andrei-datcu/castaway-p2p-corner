# castaway-p2p-corner

Castaway kodi addon is now deprecated, so many website parsers do not work anymore. In this repo I 've fixed some of them.

We need to replace the .py files on castaway resources folder:


For LibreElec / OpenElec (on rpi2-3):
```bash
scp *.py <kodi ip>:~/.kodi/addons/plugin.video.castaway/resources/lib/sources/p2p_sport/
```
